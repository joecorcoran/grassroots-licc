We want a Constituency Labour Party that:

* Brings together Labour Party members working and living outside of the UK, to campaign and organise on the issues that matter to us.
* Makes active involvement and discussion central to our CLP.
* Joins with others in the Labour Party to transform Labour in the UK into a more open, member­led party, able to convince working people of the need for a Labour Government.
* Actively organises campaigns with social democratic, socialist, and labour parties and organisations and trade unions around the world to:
    * put migrants' rights at the centre of campaigning work;
    * combat the rise of xenophobia and all other forms of prejudice and discrimination;
    * redistribute wealth and power from the few to the many;
    * put people and planet before profit and narrow corporate interests;
    * invest in high-quality jobs and infrastructure;
    * reverse the privatisation of railways, the energy sector and public services;
    * provide protection at work and strong collective bargaining to end workplace injustices;
    * provide decent homes for all, from both public and private sector sources.

In addition to our five candidates, we support the re-election of the current LICC Secretary Lorraine Hardy.
