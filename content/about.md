We want a Constituency Labour Party that:

* Brings together Labour Party members working and living outside of the UK to campaign and organise on the issues that matter to us.
* Makes active involvement and discussion central to our CLP
* Joins with others in the Labour Party to transform Labour in the UK into a more open, member-­led party able to convince working people of the need  for a Labour Government
* Actively organises campaigns with social democratic, socialist, and labour parties and organisations and trade unions around the world to:
    * Put migrants' rights at the centre of campaigning work;
    * To combat the rise of xenophobia and all other forms of prejudice and discrimination;
    * Redistribute wealth and power from the few to the many;
    * Put people and planet before profit and narrow corporate interests;
    * Invest in high-quality jobs and infrastructure;
    * Reverse the privatisation of railways, the energy sector and public services;
    * Provide protection at work and strong collective bargaining to end workplace injustices;
    * Provide decent homes for all in both the public and private sector.
