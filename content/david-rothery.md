Those living outside the UK face the greatest uncertainty since WW2. We need an LICC committee visibly supporting and uniting us. 
Social media makes the world a smaller place than 20 years ago instantly connecting party members around the globe but the potential is not being optimised.
Labour International should and can be a bottom up, democratic fountain of skills from within our membership.

We should encourage members everywhere to set up local groups, where numbers, geographical reach and method of meeting are totally flexible allowing for local circumstances. If elected, I will work tirelessly to create an active, supportive and open LI in the democratic socialist tradition of our great party, which I rejoined in 2015 following Jeremy Corbyn's election. I have a background in financial controlling and was a trade union branch treasurer for many years.
