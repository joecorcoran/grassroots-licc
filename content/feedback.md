Here are some of the first suggestions we've received:

* Greater transparency, accountability, and responsiveness
* Bottom-up structure
* More vocal
* More left-wing, attract more Corbyn supporters
* Make it easy for members to find each other, communicate with each other (also online and with video links), and campaign together
* Our own MP or MEP
* Less Euro-centric, more democratic organisation
* Committee members (or at least co-opted members) on all continents.
* More co-opted members on the committee to encourage wider participation and communication.
* Active linking to similar organisations in all countries where we have a presence
