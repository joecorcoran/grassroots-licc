There are 5.6 million British migrants around the world, 3500 of us in Labour International. Our future is more uncertain than it has been for decades.
That's why we need an active, campaigning LI. The LI must campaign for migrant rights in the UK, in Europe and in the rest of the world.

Our Momentum Grassroot candidates will get the LICC to harness the enthusiasm of new and returning members. We stand for:

* Redistributing wealth and power from the few to the many;
* Putting people and planet before profit and narrow corporate interests;
* Building a society free from all types of discrimination;
* Providing protection at work and strong collective bargaining to end workplace injustices.

I joined the Labour Party in 1978 and was active in miners' solidarity and student politics before leaving the UK. I now work on EU tax and trade issues.
