I have worked in the public/voluntary sector with deprived and immigrant communities, developing community/volunteer activism &#8212; useful skills and knowledge to help build a migrant rights campaign to protect UK and EU immigrants against increasing xenophobia and anti-immigrant racism in Europe and beyond.

LI should promote an alternative message to Tory isolationism and the scapegoating of immigrants, supporting the LP to address the real issues causing inequality and poverty: privatisation and cuts in public services, low pay in poorly regulated labour markets, neglect of left behind communities. As a part of our slate, I will work to make LI:

* Outward looking, with LICC as a focal information point for members, and a link to the wider movement;
* Support members to build local LI groups, strengthen links with in-country socialist groups, campaigns and organisations, building tools to inform and support members to become more active in their communities.
